# Project Setup Instructions

## Documentation Approach

**Date**: 4 de fevereiro de 2026

### Core Instruction
All instructions, requirements, and decisions communicated during the project should be recorded in the `.github/copilot-instructions` folder in a well-structured manner. Different topics should be organized into separate files and folders for clarity and maintainability.

### Initial State
- Starting with an empty git repository
- Documentation begins with this very instruction to ensure meta-awareness

### Organization Principles
- Keep related topics together
- Use descriptive filenames
- Maintain a README for navigation
- Update documentation as the project evolves
